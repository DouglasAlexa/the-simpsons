                The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the 
                Fox Broadcasting Company.[1][2][3] The series is a satirical depiction of 
                American life, epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer, 
                Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of 
                Springfield and parodies American culture and society, television, and the 
                human condition. <br/><br/>The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a 
                solicitation for a series of animated shorts with producer James L. Brooks. 
                He created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own 
                family members, substituting Bart for his own name; he thought Simpson was 
                a funny name in that it sounded similar to "simpleton".[4] The shorts became 
                a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the 
                sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became Fox's first 
                series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989–1990). <br/><br/>Since its debut 
                on December 17, 1989, 709 episodes of the show have been broadcast. It is the 
                longest-running American animated series, longest-running American sitcom, and 
                the longest-running American scripted primetime television series, both in terms 
                of seasons and number of episodes. A feature-length film, The Simpsons Movie, 
                was released in theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, and grossed over $527 
                million, with a sequel in development as of 2018. The series has also spawned 
                numerous comic book series, video games, books, and other related media, 
                as well as a billion-dollar merchandising industry. The Simpsons is a joint 
                production by Gracie Films and 20th Television.[5] On March 3, 2021, the series 
                was announced to have been renewed for seasons 33 and 34,[6] which were later 
                confirmed to have 22 episodes each,[7] increasing the episode count from 706 to 
                750. Its thirty-third season premiered on September 26, 2021. <br/><br/>The Simpsons 
                received acclaim throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally 
                considered its "golden age". Since then, it has been criticized for a perceived 
                decline in quality. Time named it the 20th century's best television series,[8] 
                and Erik Adams of The A.V. Club named it "television's crowning achievement 
                regardless of format".[9] On January 14, 2000, the Simpson family was awarded a 
                star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It has won dozens of awards since it 
                debuted as a series, including 34 Primetime Emmy Awards, 34 Annie Awards, and 2 
                Peabody Awards. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase of "D'oh!" has been adopted 
                into the English language, while The Simpsons has influenced many other later 
                adult-oriented animated sitcoms.
